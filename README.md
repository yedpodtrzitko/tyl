# TYL

Josef Kajetán Tyl (4 February 1808 – 11 July 1856; Czech pronunciation: [ˈjozɛf ˈkajɛtaːn ˈtɪl]) was a significant Czech dramatist, writer, and actor. He was a notable figure in the Czech National Revival movement and is best known as the author of the current national anthem of the Czech Republic. [source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Kajet%C3%A1n_Tyl) 

Tyl's name is pronounced the same as TIL (Today I Learned) in Czech language, so that's something TYL (Today You Learned).
